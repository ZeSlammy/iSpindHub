# iSpindHub Startup & Configuration
## _Start here once you've flashed your device_

iSpindHub needs to be connected to a Wifi network in order to work properly.
Once it is, the display changes and starts displaying iSpindle info.

- Set Up using the WiFi config wizard
- Restarts
- ✨Magic ✨

## How it should work

- When you start the D1 mini for the first time, it should display
iSpinHub x.y.z
by Slammy
- While not configured, that's all it will display
- If from your PC or phone you look for Wifi networks, you should see one call iSpindHub
- Connect to it, it should bring you to the config page
- Chose the Wifi you want your iSpindHub to connect to and enter password
- Once done, the D1 Mini will reboot
- The screen will then display
iSpinHub x.y.z
by Slammy
Connected
- Then after a while (5 seconds) will display iSpindel Information (I put some dummy file in the image)
