# **iSpindHub**

 <!-- TOC -->autoauto- [**iSpindHub**](#ispindhub)autoauto<!-- /TOC -->

 This project is widely inspired by [**TiltBridge**](https://www.tiltbridge.com/) and [**Nautilis' iSpindel Relay**](http://www.nautilis.eu/en/portfolio-item/nautilis-ispindel-relay/).

 It is basically a receiver to get information from your iSpindels and display it allowing you to use your iSpindel(s) even if you do not have WiFi available in your brew cave.
 It also acts as a WiFi repetiter and will push iSpindel information to various services (BrewFather, LittleBock, CraftBeerPi etc).
